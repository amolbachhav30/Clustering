# Set your directory to the folder where you have downloaded the SKU dataset
# To clean up the memory of your current R session run the following line
rm(list=ls(all=TRUE))
# Let's load our dataset
data=read.table('DATA_2.01_SKU.csv', header = T,sep=',') # The function read.table enables us to read flat files such as .csv files

# Now let's have a look at our variables and see some summary statistics
str(data) # The str() function shows the structure of your dataset and details the type of variables that it contains
summary(data) # The summary() function provides for each variable in your dataset the minimum, mean, maximum and quartiles
head(data)
# Let's plot our data to see if we can identify groups visually 
plot(data$CV, data$ADS, main = "SKU Example", ylab="Average Daily Sales", xlab= "Coefficient of Variation")
abline(v=0.2, col = "red") # we can draw a vertical line by using the abline function and passing it the v argument
abline(h=4, col="red") # we can draw a horizontal line by using the abline function and passing it the h argument
text(0.15,9.7, "Horses", col = "red") # we can add some text to our plot by using the text() function, here to label the group "Horses"
text(0.65,9, "Wild Bulls", col = "red") # and group "Wild Bulls"
text(0.8,2, "Crickets", col = "red") # and group "Crickets"
# Let's find groups using hierarchical clustering and check if we obtain similar results
testdata=data  # To keep our dataset safe, let's create a copy of it called "testdata"
testdata = scale(testdata) # To keep our dataset safe, let's create a copy of it called "testdata"

d = dist(testdata, method = "euclidean") # the dist() function computes the distances of all the observations in our dataset
hcward = hclust(d, method="ward.D") # hclust() function performs hiearchical clustering, we pass it the distances, and we set the method argument to "ward.D"

data$groups<-cutree(hcward,k=2) # assign our points to our k=3 clusters 

# The lattice library provides a complete set of functions for producing advanced plots.
#install.packages("lattice") #install the lattice package by using the install.packages() function
library(lattice) # load the lattice package by using the library() function and passing it the name of the package you wish to load
